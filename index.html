            <h1><span class="first">My Path to</span> <span class="second">#100DaysOfCode</span></h1>
            <p>I found an article on #100DaysOfX,100 days before today. I got my 3 subjects exam next week. Its been 2 months that
                    I was on this path though, I was giving limited, unfocused time. That day I commited myself to give atleast 1 hour a 
                    day and post what I did every day on twitter.There was my own rules of doing pomodoro. I missed 1 day on "Tihar Bhaitika"
                    and I deduct 2 days to not to repeat again. Though some day I could able to do half an hour, got unfocused and sleepy 
                    because of long shift work. Some days, working 7am till 10pm on restaurant and reaching home tried to do small pomo of 
                    15 minutes, I feel tired and my eyes used to close in between, and on break and travel I used to read some documentation.
